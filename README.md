### 1.3 Key Components
- **backend**: Backend, control the whole system, respond to frontend requests and send message to rabbitmq, based on springboot and Java.

- **frontend**: User interface, base on Vue.

- **jiexi-server**: Parse the file(docx, doc, pdf) to pure txt for further process and interact with MinIO, based on Java.

- **retrieve-server**: Vectorize and parallelly upload file chunks, based on Python and flask.

- **chat-server**: Provide chat service, based on Python and flask.

## 2. Environment Setup

### 2.1 Prerequisites
- **Git**
- **Kubernetes**
- **AWS CLI**
- **helm**
- **Java**
- **Maven**
- **Python3 and libs**
- **Javascript**
- **Vue**

### 2.2 Installation
If you are using a Linux distribution or MacOS, all these requirements can be installed using your package manager(zypper, homebrew, apt-get, pacman), just run as follow:

```shell
${your_package_manager} install kubenetes
```

## 3. Application Deployment
**Note that this section has been split into separate instruction files so there is a `readme.md` in each subfolder of the project that gives very detailed deployment and debugging instructions.**

Contents of each subfolder are as follow:

1. `readme.md`: Deployment documentation providing detailed deployment and debugging guidance.

2. `yamls/*.yaml`: Kubernetes configuration files

3. `test/*.test`: Test code

4. `src`: Source code of microservice

Please follow the order 1 -> 2 -> 3 for configuration and deployment:

1. AWS-configure, EFS

2. Minio, elastic-search, monitoring-logging, ndbmysql, rabbitmqï¼Œweaviate, retrieve-server, ai-chat-server, jiexi-server

3. backend, frontend

After deployment, you can log in and use the service by accessing the port exposed by the frontend.

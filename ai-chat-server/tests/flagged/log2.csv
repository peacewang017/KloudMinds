The Netherlands came from behind to see off Turkey and set up a semi-final against England at Euro 2024.

An own goal from Mert Muldur, bundling the ball over his goalline under pressure from Cody Gakpo, meant the Dutch clawed back the lead having trailed at the break.

Centre-back Samet Akaydin had deservedly put Turkey in front when he headed in Arda Guler's dinked cross, capping an impressive first-half display.

He ran over to the Turkey fans, kissed the badge on his shirt and knelt down to pray in front of them, while substitutes sprinted down the touchline.

But their celebrations would not last as the Netherlands, who had a poor first half, responded after the break, buoyed by substitute Wout Weghorst.

They found an equaliser through Stefan de Vrij's header, moments after Weghorst made a crucial interception inside his own box to stop Turkey's Kaan Ayhan getting to a rebound.

Turkey almost doubled their lead when Real Madrid's Guler bent a brilliant free-kick on to the post, but did not capitalise when they had their chances.

It means Ronald Koeman's side will now take on England in Dortmund on Wednesday (20:00 BST) after Gareth Southgate's team beat Switzerland on penalties, with a place in the final against either France or Spain at stake.

Article 2.
England stepped back from the brink of a Euro 2024 exit again as they secured a semi-final place with victory over Switzerland on penalties in Dusseldorf.

Gareth Southgate’s side, who were rescued by Jude Bellingham’s spectacular late equaliser in the last 16 against Slovakia, were in trouble once more when Breel Embolo stole in at the far post to put Switzerland ahead with only 15 minutes left.

Bukayo Saka then produced a moment of individual brilliance of the sort England have relied on heavily throughout the tournament to equalise with a fierce low shot five minutes later.

Extra time failed to find a winner, England going through with a set of flawless penalties after goalkeeper Jordan Pickford saved Manuel Akanji’s first spot-kick.

Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Saka and Ivan Toney were all successful before substitute Trent Alexander-Arnold hammered home the decisive penalty in front of England’s delirious supporters.

They can now look forward to a semi-final against the Netherlands in Dortmund on Wednesday at 20:00 BST. It will be the first time the two countries have faced each other at a major tournament since the group stage of Euro 96.

Article 3.
Lamine Yamal became the youngest goalscorer in European Championship history as Spain beat France in an absorbing contest to reach the final of Euro 2024.

After Randal Kolo Muani headed in Kylian Mbappe's cross to give France an early lead, Yamal curled home a stunning strike from outside the box to write his name into the record books by scoring at the age of 16 years and 362 days.

Yamal's goal came in the 21st minute, and Spain were ahead just four minutes later as Dani Olmo's shot was turned home by France defender Jules Kounde.

France had to come out fighting after a thrilling first half - and they did just that, with Aurelien Tchouameni having a header saved and Mbappe denied from an ambitious effort.

The France captain, playing without a face mask for the first time since breaking his nose at the start of the tournament, had a big chance to equalise late on - but he shot high over the bar in a moment that summed up his recent form.

While Spain have been the most attacking side at the tournament to date, here they showed they have the defence to match as they stayed on course for a fourth European Championship title.

France, for their part, came up short in attack against a side that will take some stopping when they face either England or the Netherlands in Sunday's final.

Article 4.
England will face Spain in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin on Sunday after a last-minute strike from substitute Ollie Watkins sealed victory over the Netherlands.

Gareth Southgate's side looked to be going into extra time for the third successive game after Harry Kane's contentious first-half penalty equalised a thunderous early strike from Xavi Simons until Watkins struck.

England dominated the first half, with Phil Foden outstanding, hitting the post with one long-range effort and drawing a fine save from Dutch keeper Bart Verbruggen.

The Netherlands, who saw Denzel Dumfries' header hit the bar before the break, took control after the break and it required important interventions from keeper Jordan Pickford to keep England level.

England were facing another extra 30 minutes until a superb late strike on the turn from Watkins, on for Kane, sent England into their second successive European Championship final on a dramatic night in Dortmund.

Article 5.
England’s quest to end 58 years of pain and disappointment ended in failure as they were beaten by Spain in the Euro 2024 final at Berlin's Olympiastadion.

Gareth Southgate's side were sunk by Mikel Oyarzabal's late winner to leave England heartbroken again in a second successive European Championship final and unable to end the long wait for success for the men's team.

Spain's young star wingers combined to give them the lead two minutes after the break as Lamine Yamal's pass opened up space for Nico Williams to beat England keeper Jordan Pickford with a powerful low finish.

England captain Harry Kane was out of sorts once more and was substituted on the hour and it was Cole Palmer - on for Kobbie Mainoo - who raised hopes of another dramatic comeback with a composed left-foot strike after 73 minutes.

It was Spain, however, who snatched the win four minutes from time as Oyarzabal slid home Marc Cucurella's cross to leave England the nearly men once more.
